# LineOut.js
This is a micro-library which wraps the **WebAudio API** to provide a chaining interface

This library encourages intuitive functional programming, when creating a network of *AudioNodes* to modulate sound.

## Why do I need this?
When using the native WebAudio API, you normally have to create your nodes and connect them to each other, starting with the output and ending with the input.
